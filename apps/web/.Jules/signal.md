## 2024-05-23 - Missing Product Schema
**Learning:** The core entity "Product" lacks JSON-LD Structured Data, which prevents Rich Snippets (price, availability) from appearing in search results, significantly lowering CTR potential for an e-commerce site.
**Action:** Always implement `Product` schema on PDPs using a dedicated component that maps internal data models to Schema.org properties.
